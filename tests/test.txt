# Common elements

## A header 2 with id

This could be a paragraph ending with the trick

> Now this is a blockquote having the same trick at the end. It is a single
paragraph.

I've forgot to put in a paragraph to separate these.

> This will probably not work.

>> Inner blockquote not sure it will actually work.

> And this is the outer/ending paragraph.

And last but not least a list:

  1. first item .
  2. second item[[1](test.html#fn-1)]
  3. third item

There's also [a link](http://yahoo.com) and then `some code`. Does it work
`[this way](http://yahoo.com "{{rel='external nofollow'}}")`? But I also need
a normal [link](http://yahoo.com).

Image is exactly the same:

![alt text](http://yahoo.com)

And now two advanced examples

The other one would be

  * simple l 1
  * simple l 2 
    * inner 2.1
    * inner 2.3
  * simple l 3
  1. paragraph l 1

  2. para l 2

  3. para l 3

continuation paragraph

  4. paragraph 4

Find a Pygments code snippet to see how it works

    
    
    from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    import urllib2
    soup = BeautifulSoup(urllib2.urlopen('http://java.sun.com').read())
    menu = soup.findAll('div',attrs={'class':'pad'})
    for subMenu in menu:
    links = subMenu.findAll('a')
    for link in links:
    print "%s : %s" % (link.string, link['href'])
    

# Special elements

A series of elements insert, <del>delete</del>, quote, abbr that are not
natively supported.

Then is time for definition lists:

Term 1

    A term definition
Term 2

    

multi paragraph definition

not sure this is actually supported

Also DIVs even if they're wrong, they should still work.
